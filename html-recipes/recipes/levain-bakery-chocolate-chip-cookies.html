        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If youâ€™ve traveled to, or live in New York City, you have probably heard of Levain Bakery and their famous chocolate chip cookies. On my last trip back east, I made a stop at the popular bakery on West 74th Street to see for myself if this was indeed the best chocolate chip cookie in the world!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter cut into tablespoons</li>
            <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2-1 3/4 cup all purpose flour* see notes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups walnut halves</li>
            <li>2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Pre heat oven to 400 degrees and set rack in middle of oven.</li>
            <li>Place butter into bowl and turn mixer on low. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment.</li>
            <li>Add sugars and beat butter until smooth on medium speed. This should take about 1 minute. Mix until the butter pieces are completely blended with the sugar and is no longer visible in pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and beat on medium just until incorporated with butter and sugars, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Turn the mixer off. Add the cake flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Pulse the dry ingredients on low until the wet and dry ingredients are mixed together.</li>
            <li>Pour the walnuts into the batter all at once. Pulse the batter 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>Pour the chocolate chips into the batter and pulse again 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter out onto a clean surface. Fold the dough together a few times until all of the chocolate chips and walnuts are mixed into the batter.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces about 6 oz each. Use your hands to shape cookies. Do not use a cookie or ice cream scoop. The cookies are meant to be roughly shaped. Do not flatten the dough.</li>
